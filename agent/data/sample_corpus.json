      "content": "# Algebra Fundamentals\n\n## Linear Equations\nA linear equation is an equation that makes a straight line when graphed. The general form is y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.\n\n### Solving Linear Equations\n1. Combine like terms\n2. Move variables to one side\n3. Move constants to the other side\n4. Divide by coefficient\n\n### Example\nSolve: 2x + 3 = 11\n1. Subtract 3 from both sides: 2x = 8\n2. Divide both sides by 2: x = 4\n\n### Quadratic Formula\nFor equations in the form ax² + bx + c = 0:\nx = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a",

Work is done when a force moves an object.\n\n### Kinetic Energy\nKE = ½mv² where m is mass and v is velocity\n\n### Potential Energy\nPE = mgh where m is mass, g is gravity, and h is height\n\n### Conservation of Energy\nEnergy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another.",
